  <h1>About me</h1>
  <div class="description">
    Im an energetic 31-year-old man, recently graduated as a softwareengineer,
    who daily takes pleasure in seeking new knowledge. I am motivated by the
    challenge of solving complex problems through coding, which is why I have
    chosen the software technology track. From my time as a dance instructor, I
    learned how to lead andmaintain my head calm in stressful situations and
    also how to worktogether as a team, which I have used a lot in different
    projects.
